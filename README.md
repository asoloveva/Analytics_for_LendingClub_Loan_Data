# Analytics_for_LendingClub_Loan_Data

  This project has been realized by applying machine learning techniques to LendingClub loan data. LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending platform which has been bringing borrowers and lenders together since 2007. 

  The three types of ML techniques (Linear Regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN)) with different configurations have been built during the project in order to predict interest rate and grade of the loan.

During the project following software have been used:
1. Tableau to visualize loan data to understand behavior of various characteristics by interest rate and loan grade
2. RStudio to build machine learning techniques to predict an interest rate and a loan grade
